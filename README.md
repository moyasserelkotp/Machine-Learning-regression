# Machine Learning Regression Techniques

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating various regression techniques in machine learning using Python. The notebook uses the diabetes dataset as an example to showcase different regression methods.

## 📋 Contents

The notebook covers the following regression techniques:

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Simple Linear Regression
   - Multiple Linear Regression
   - Model evaluation and visualization

2. **Polynomial Regression**
   - Feature transformation
   - Degree selection
   - Overfitting analysis

3. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Coefficient shrinkage
   - Performance comparison

4. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**
   - Feature selection
   - Sparse solutions
   - Model interpretation

5. **Elastic Net Regression**
   - Combined L1 and L2 regularization
   - Balance between Ridge and Lasso
   - Handling correlated features

6. **Stepwise Regression**
   - Forward-backward selection
   - P-value based feature selection
   - Model performance tracking

## 🔧 Requirements

The following Python libraries are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

## 📊 Datasets

The notebook uses the following datasets:
- Diabetes dataset (built-in from scikit-learn)
